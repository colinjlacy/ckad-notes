# Multi-Container Pods
- keeping in mind the idea of microservices
    - develop nad deploy code independently
    - keep things clean
- may be cases when you need to deploy two things together and keep them aligned
    - e.g. a web server and a logging agent
    - don't wnat to bloat the web server code by including a logging agent in its codebase
    - would still like them to be developed/maintained seperately
    - good use case for multi-container pods
        - have access to the same network space
        - have access to the same volumes
- to create a multi-container pod, add the second container to the `spec.containers[]` list
- Design patterns:
    - sidecar: a helper container simply deployed alongside the main container, meant to do a thing
    - adapter: a helper that runs adapter functionality, like converting logs to a common format
    - ambassador: a proxy to connect to external resources
        - e.g. a DB connection is always referred to in the main container as "localhost"
        - by consequence, the ambassador container handles the connection abstraction to whichever env target DB is appropriate
